  "abstract": "Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guideline EP39—A Hierarchical Approach to Selecting Surrogate Samples for \nthe Evaluation of In Vitro Medical Laboratory Tests establishes a standard definition of a surrogate sample. It presents a \nhierarchical approach for determining when to use surrogate samples and selecting an appropriate one. It also describes \nelements of a surrogate sample plan and includes technical preparation guidance for the characteristic to be measured or \ndetected and for artificial matrix compositions. This guideline provides examples for specific performance study types."
